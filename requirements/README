Updating requirements
---------------------

Requirement input files form a hierarchy using `-r <parent>.in`:

    base.in
      |-- dev.in
      `-- prod.in

To update packages add them to a suitable requirements.in file and run:

    pip-compile requirements.in

The generated txt files contain all requirements including those of the parents.
Repeat this step for all requirement files depending on base.in!

Keep the base/production requirements clean! Put all development requirements
or special/local requirements in separate files.

The requirements.txt file in the project root for compatibility only uses
base.txt as parent. Do not put any requirements in there directly!

Tip: find outdated packages in your venv:

    pip list --outdated
